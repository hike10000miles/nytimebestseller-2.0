# bestbooks

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.12.1.

Finally fixed the probrems I had with yomen angular generator. This project is the same with the nytimebestseller project. Only this time, the structure of the data is different; I added a new function, now you can make a list of the books you like. The styling changed a little too, the design is responsive, therefore you can look at it by phone or tablet. 

You can see the end result at http://hike10000miles.github.io/nytimebestseller-2.0/#/
